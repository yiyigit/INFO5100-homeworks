1. ArrayList is a data structure that stores elements in an array, which allows access by index in O(1) time. 
On the other hand, LinkedList stores both data and address of next and previous node. So to retireve an element, you have to 
iterate LinkedList with O(N) time.
2. removing and adding elements is faster in LinkedList than ArrayList. Because ArrayList needs to rearrange the whole list which is 
O(N)time and LinkedList needs only change the address to point to mentioned elements which is O(1) time.
